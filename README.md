## <a name="devnotes"></a> Misc. Dev Notes:
### Drawing Images vs Drawing Bodies w/ matter js
Matter.js rects are drawn from the center, whereas ctx.draw draws a rect / sprite image from the top left. To fix this: whenever an image is being drawn for an object that has a respective body, the ctx.draw will need some padding. 

### Loading in images  
Since this game is aimed to be ran in a browser (client side) It does not seem possible to utilze [this method with node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/manipulating-files/working-with-folders-in-nodejs) in order to pre load images for my sprites.  Therefore, it seems that I'm now left with two choices:

1. Add the images for the game in the html file as scripts and load them using get element by id 
1. Utilize "promises".

### Utilizing JavaScript Modules
Now that that code base for main has been switched to javascript [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), the code base is now subject to the [CORS Policy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52919331/access-to-script-at-from-origin-null-has-been-blocked-by-cors-policy).  Pros include being able to utilze keyterms such as "Export" and "Import" to better track the scripts.  However this limits being able to use the html file without needing to be be hosted on a server.
